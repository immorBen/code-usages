### Magics
- **Line Magics**: line magics are analogous to command line calls. They begin with a % and the remainder of the line is the argument, which is passed without parenthesis or quotations.
- **Cell Magics**: cell magics operate on entire cells, that is on multiple lines. They receive the whole block as a single string and begin with %%.
